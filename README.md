## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    # Replace with your actual repository URL
    git clone git@github.com:boycott-beacon/boycott-beacon.github.io.git
    cd boycott-beacon-website
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Ensure Node.js and npm are installed
    npm install
    ```
    *This installs helper packages for build scripts.*

3.  **Install Hugo:**
    Make sure you have Hugo (Extended version, minimum `0.115.1`) installed. See [Hugo Installation Guide](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).

4.  **Install Build Tools:**
  *   **ImageMagick:** Required for generating favicons and logos.
      ```bash
      # On Debian/Ubuntu
      sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install imagemagick
      # On macOS (using Homebrew)
      # brew install imagemagick
      ```
  *   **wkhtmltoimage:** Required for generating Open Graph images. Download from the [wkhtmltopdf website](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) and ensure it's in your system's PATH.

5.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    # Using npm script (Recommended, runs pre-build steps if any)
    npm run dev
    # Or directly using Hugo
    # hugo server --buildFuture
    ```
    *The site will be available at `http://localhost:1313/` (or another port if 1313 is busy).*
