### About

The **"Defend Water Rights"** campaign exposes corporations that prioritize profit over people by exploiting public water resources. From draining aquifers in drought-stricken regions to contaminating drinking water with toxic chemicals, these companies jeopardize ecosystems and human health. This movement empowers communities to take action through boycotts, advocacy, and education.

### Key Issues

- **Privatization**: Companies like Nestl√© (BlueTriton) extract millions of gallons of water for bottled products, often at the expense of local communities.
- **Pollution**: Chemical giants (DuPont, Dow) have contaminated water supplies with PFAS and other toxins.
- **Over-Extraction**: Beverage corporations (Coca-Cola, PepsiCo) exacerbate water scarcity in vulnerable areas.

### How to Participate

1. **Boycott**: Avoid products from implicated companies (see [downloadable list](#)).
2. **Advocate**: Support legislation like the **Water Affordability, Transparency, and Equity (WATE) Act**.
3. **Educate**: Share resources on social media with #WaterIsAHumanRight.

### Campaign Demands

- **Transparency**: Public disclosure of corporate water usage and impacts.
- **Restitution**: Cleanup of polluted water sources and compensation for affected communities.
- **Policy Change**: Bans on water extraction in drought zones and stricter pollution fines.
