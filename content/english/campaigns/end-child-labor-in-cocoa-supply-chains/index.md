### About

The **"End Child Labor in Cocoa Supply Chains"** campaign exposes the chocolate industry's ongoing exploitation of children in West African cocoa farms. Despite two decades of promises, major manufacturers continue to profit from child labor in their supply chains.

### Key Issues

- **Unfulfilled Commitments**: The industry has missed every deadline to eliminate child labor since 2005
- **Dangerous Work Environments**: Children perform hazardous agricultural work instead of attending school
- **Systemic Issues**: Complex supply chains enable companies to avoid responsibility

### Evidence

Documented cases include:
- Minors performing dangerous tasks like clearing brush with machetes
- Exposure to agricultural chemicals without protective equipment
- Debt bondage situations trapping families in cycles of exploitation
- Widespread lack of educational opportunities in cocoa-growing regions

### How to Participate

1. **Consumer Action**: Use our [brand guide](#) to make ethical purchasing decisions
2. **Policy Support**: Contact legislators about the **Child-Free Cocoa Act**
3. **Awareness**: Share #NoChildLaborCocoa on social media

### Campaign Demands

- **Supply Chain Reform**: Implement and fund rigorous monitoring systems
- **Corporate Transparency**: Publish verified supply chain audits annually
- **Community Investment**: Fund education and youth programs in cocoa regions
- **Third-Party Verification**: Establish independent monitoring bodies
