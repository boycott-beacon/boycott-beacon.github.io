### About This Test Campaign

This page describes an **example campaign** created solely for testing and demonstrating the features of the Boycott Beacon browser extension and website theme. The domains listed (like `example.com`, `example.org`) are standard internet domain names used for documentation and testing â€“ they are **not** part of a real boycott.

### Purpose

-   Demonstrate how campaign details are displayed.
-   Test the layout for targets, reasons, and citations.
-   Show how users can subscribe using the Boycott Beacon extension.
-   Verify the functionality of the website template.

### How to Use for Testing

1.  **Subscribe (Requires Extension):** Click the "Subscribe to Campaign" button (if you have the Boycott Beacon extension installed) to add this test list to your extension.
2.  **Visit Targets:** Navigate to `http://example.com`, `http://example.org`, or `http://example.net` in your browser.
3.  **Observe:** You should see the Boycott Beacon ribbon appear, displaying the reasons and details defined in the `campaign.json` file for this test campaign.

### Example Demands (Placeholder)

-   Demand 1: Verify ribbon display.
-   Demand 2: Check citation formatting.
-   Demand 3: Ensure subscription works.
