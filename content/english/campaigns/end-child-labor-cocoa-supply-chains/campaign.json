Investigations have revealed children as young as 10 working in hazardous conditions on cocoa farms supplying Nestlé, often working 12+ hour days with no access to education. Despite pledges to eradicate child labor by 2005, then 2010, then 2020, Nestlé continues to profit from this exploitation.",
