## Our Mission

In an increasingly complex world, making conscious choices can be difficult. Boycott Beacon was created to empower you to align your online activity with your values by providing timely, relevant information directly where you need it â€“ your browser. We aim to make information accessible without compromising user privacy or control, fostering a more informed and ethical online environment.

## How It Works

Boycott Beacon operates on simple, transparent principles:

*   **Campaign Manifests:** You subscribe to publicly available URLs pointing to `campaign.json` files. These are simple lists defining which websites are targeted by a specific boycott campaign and why.
*   **Local Processing:** When you visit a webpage, the extension checks its domain against the campaign lists you've subscribed to. **This check happens entirely within your browser.**
*   **No Central Servers:** Your browsing history, the sites you visit, and the campaigns you subscribe to are **never** sent to us or any third party. Boycott Beacon works offline after fetching the initial campaign lists.
*   **Privacy First:** Because all processing is local, your browsing habits remain private.

## Core Principles

*   **User Control:** You decide which campaigns to follow. Boycott Beacon simply provides the information based on your choices.
*   **Privacy:** We fundamentally believe your browsing data is yours. The extension is designed from the ground up to protect it.
*   **Transparency:** Boycott Beacon is fully open-source. You can inspect the code to verify how it works and ensure its privacy claims.
*   **Simplicity:** We aim for an easy-to-use interface for both subscribing to campaigns and understanding the alerts.

## Open Source & Trust

Transparency is key to trust. Boycott Beacon's code is publicly available on GitHub. We encourage you to review it, report issues, and contribute to its development.
